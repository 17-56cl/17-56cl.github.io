## Welcome to 17-56

This is the GitHub page of [17-56](https://17-56.cl), where we will be posting out methodology, codes and more technical stuff!

This page is hosted on GitHub Pages and will run on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in this site, from the content in your Markdown files.

This is our first web-site outside of wordpress, so we are still noobies, have some patience!
